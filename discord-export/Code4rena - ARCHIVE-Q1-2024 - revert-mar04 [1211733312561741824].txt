Its a constant in the contract 2 ** 96


[03/05/2024 10:52] 14si2o_flint
@kalinbas Is there a deployment script? It would be useful to have an approximate idea of the values with which the contracts will be deployed.


[03/05/2024 12:38] kalinbas
No we don't have a "definitive" deployment script yet. But the important values will be _dailyLendIncreaseLimitMin and _dailyDebtIncreaseLimitMin which limit the initial daily growth. Imagine them to be maybe USDC 10000


[03/05/2024 12:39] kalinbas
_globalLendLimit and _globalDebtLimit maybe USDC 100000


[03/05/2024 12:40] kalinbas
These limits can be changed quickly if needed


[03/05/2024 12:43] 14si2o_flint
Ok I understand!


[03/05/2024 14:18] bbl4de.xyz
Is the documentation roughly up to date or should we focus on the whitepaper exclusively?

https://docs.revert.finance/revert
Introduction | Revert


[03/05/2024 15:00] hisoul22
I believe the whitepaper is up tp date


[03/05/2024 15:02] kalinbas
About the Vault it is all in the whitepaper, the other contracts like AutoRange, AutoExit, AutoCompound (which are already live in their v1) are described in their current version in the Docs https://docs.revert.finance/revert But they have been slightly changed for their v2 which is going to be used with Revert Lend


[03/05/2024 15:06] web3tycoon
about automator.sol can you say in a nutshell its like the interface to transformers..
on a high level


[03/05/2024 15:08] web3tycoon
@kalinbas hello


[03/05/2024 15:11] kalinbas
Automator has the logic to give access to operator accounts, keep protocol fees to be withdrawn by the withdrawer account, and some other commonly used functions


[03/05/2024 15:12] kalinbas
In theory any function can be called on a Transformer (there is no interface)


[03/05/2024 15:12] web3tycoon
okay is the operator the liquidity providiers or the lenders? or the bots set by the liquidity providiers


[03/05/2024 15:14] kalinbas
The operators are revert controlled EAO which can call the privileged execute function in AutoRange, AutoExit and AutoCompound contracts


[03/05/2024 15:16] kalinbas
Because there is the need to calculate off-chain swaps (for 0x or UniversalRouter) there is a possibility to take advantage and do suboptimal swaps until the configured slippage value. Thats why these operators are "trusted" EAO which are run by revert bots


[03/05/2024 15:20] web3tycoon
mmmh okay let me scope again thank you


[03/05/2024 15:30] web3tycoon
@kalinbas  can you send a link of the docs section of automators


[03/05/2024 15:33] web3tycoon
please : )


[03/05/2024 15:45] 14si2o_flint
@kalinbas Am I correct in my understanding that the V3Vault will only have 1 asset (which is USDC?) like a standard ERC4626 Vault, but the Uni V3 NFT positions are accepted as collateral for depositing liquidity and taking loans.

In this way every token (in theory) can be used for one single vault. Correct?


[03/05/2024 15:47] 0x11singh99
on whitepaper v0.1 Draft is written. So does it mean it is revert lend first time or v2 as your comment stated ?


[03/05/2024 15:48] kalinbas
true if collateralfactor > 0 for both tokens you may take a loan


[03/05/2024 15:49] kalinbas
ah sorry for the confusion, yeah.. for whitepaper there is only one version


[03/05/2024 15:50] 14si2o_flint
Is a confirmed whitelist of tokens where the collaterfactor will be set or is this decided in another manner?


[03/05/2024 15:51] kalinbas
No confirmed list, but imagine it to be only the main tokens like ETH, BTC, USDC, DAI

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/05/2024 15:52] kalinbas
But also imagine there to be less liquid tokens with lower collateral factors / debt limits


[03/05/2024 15:52] 0x11singh99
and whitepaper is updated according to current in scope code base right ?


[03/05/2024 15:53] kalinbas
There maybe some diferences, but mostly yes

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/05/2024 21:21] mike_bello90
does anyone know What is transform mode?


[03/05/2024 21:44] kalinbas
when you call the transform() function on V3Vault it calls a method on another contract (the transformer) which is granted access to the collateral nft to "transform" it - after this transformation V3Vault checks that the collateralvalue is still large enough for the loan (otherwise it reverts)


[03/05/2024 21:46] kalinbas
you can find a more complete description in the whitepaper


[03/05/2024 22:00] jecikzerrikan
@kalinbas ,I think that @Mike_Bello was referring to the isTransformMode, which looks like a variable controlling if the operation can be called by the owner or the vault itself.


[03/05/2024 22:02] mike_bello90
thanks, but as jecikpo said I was asking about isTransformMode 🙂


[03/05/2024 22:12] kalinbas
bool isTransformMode =
            transformedTokenId > 0 && transformedTokenId == tokenId && transformerAllowList[msg.sender];


[03/05/2024 22:14] kalinbas
isTransformMode in this context is used to decide if collateralHealth needs to be checked or not. when it is in isTransformMode collateral doesn't need to be checked at that time because the call comes from a transformer


[03/05/2024 22:14] kalinbas
so the check is done later by the transformer


[03/05/2024 22:15] kalinbas
this allows borrowing more than allowed by collateral (temporarly) - as used by LeverageTransfomer

{Reactions}
👍 (2) 🤝 

[03/05/2024 22:20] jecikzerrikan
and the transformTokenId is just to protect against reentrancy, right?


[03/05/2024 22:41] kalinbas
its used for reentrancy protection but also to know which position is the current one, when another position should replace it (see onERC721Received)

[03/06/2024 13:29] zxriptor
Can anyone enlighten me how could AutoCompound.sol::execute() function be prone to reentrancy? This is a crit from HYDN audit which was resolved by adding "nonReentrant" modifier. I am probably dumb by thinking there is no way a callback can allow a malicious user to withdraw their position in the middle of execute() function execution even without nonReentrant modifier. What am I missing?


[03/06/2024 13:39] kalinbas
The issue was about the handling of positionBalances and the fact that _setBalance and _increaseBalance are called at the end


[03/06/2024 13:41] kalinbas
and at the beginning of the method added positionBalances[params.tokenId][state.token0] to the available balances which could be done multiple times


[03/06/2024 13:45] zxriptor
yeah, so there must be a way for an attacker to withdraw their position while the code execution is between lines 120 and 175. And I can't see how that can happen


[03/06/2024 13:52] sp1cymeatball
@kalinbas here we use Q64 numbers to calculate the fee
```
state.feeAmount0 * params.rewardX64 / Q64
```
does this mean that 2^64 = 100% and for example rewardX64 = 2^64 / 2 is 50%?


[03/06/2024 13:58] kalinbas
yes

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/06/2024 13:59] kalinbas
why do you mean withdrawing, the amounts are just added to the position multiple times


[03/06/2024 14:00] kalinbas
positionBalances define how much of the contract balances belong to the position


[03/06/2024 14:01] kalinbas
but there is more tokens in the same contract


[03/06/2024 14:01] kalinbas
that belong to other positions or the protocol itself


[03/06/2024 14:01] zxriptor
it is from HYDN report: "Between the storage read of the pending withdrawal balance on the set of the new balance,** malicious users can withdraw**, so the balance goes to zero and at the end of the compounding execution a new pending balance is set with the assumption that the previous pending balance hasn't changed."


[03/06/2024 14:02] kalinbas
withdraw is the wrong word maybe.. they mean "withdraw" from the positionBalances


[03/06/2024 14:10] zxriptor
thank you for your patience and responses, I appreciate it. If you could point out how reentrancy can be realized (assuming there is no nonReentrant modifier)  in the concerned code block, I think that is all I am stuck as of now. thank you


[03/06/2024 14:27] kalinbas
Sorry i was confused, the reentrancy could happen with a forged token and withdrawLeftoverBalances() function, not the execute() function


[03/06/2024 14:42] escrow1337
the way it was described within the report, it does not really seem like reentrancy was the main problem, but rather an extension to a pre-existing problem where the access control is flawed allowing other positions to be collected. so your confusion is definitely not wrong. however, the relevant part to the actual title of that bug, is in the last paragraph starting "Between the storage..."

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/06/2024 14:42] escrow1337
their impact arguably concludes 2 bugs rather than just a singular reentrancy

[03/06/2024 14:47] zxriptor
> however, the relevant part to the actual title of that bug, is in the last paragraph starting "Between the storage..."
that is where my confusion is. I see no reentrancy but if we consider "flawed" ERC20 then it makes sense though


[03/07/2024 01:09] smartcontractprogrammer
Would this be a valid finding?

What is the collatarization ratio and liquidation criteria ?

Worked out. Thank you, sir!


[03/07/2024 09:16] web3tycoon
@kalinbas hello, in AutoExit.sol 
so there two tokens which we can auto swap to the other during the swapping lets say the current tick cross the lowerr token0 tick should token1 be swapped token0 or vice versa
just clarification


[03/07/2024 09:19] kalinbas
"the current tick cross the lowerr token0 tick" - when this happens all liquidity will be in token0 - so depending on config position is closed with or without swap. if a swap is done all tokens are swapped to the other token (in this case token1)


[03/07/2024 09:19] kalinbas
check the whitepaper and the _checkLoanIsHealthy() function


[03/07/2024 09:33] guy_in0xnito
Ya i saw the _check...healthy() where it tells if debt<collateral it is not healthy 
More of  thinking of the ratio ?

Can you tell me where in the docs i can find it ?


[03/07/2024 09:37] kalinbas
its used in the same method: _calculateTokenCollateralFactorX32()


[03/07/2024 12:28] youssefabk
Hi, do anyone know where can I find a mock for the nonfungibleTokenManger ?


[03/07/2024 12:47] kalinbas
Not that i know about but you can build one like here for example. https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-periphery/blob/main/contracts/test/MockTimeNonfungiblePositionManager.sol


[03/07/2024 12:48] kalinbas
Tests use mostly forked mainnet state


[03/07/2024 13:16] web3tycoon
@kalinbas  when testing autoexit.t,sol am getting this evm revert error which seems comes from slot0 
when trying to execute swap after i have set up config, how did you guys over this ? please


[03/07/2024 13:19] web3tycoon
like when i call execute using swapData its giving me an error even when i pass getDAIToUSDSwapData()


[03/07/2024 13:23] web3tycoon
@kalinbas  in simple terms how can i replicate bytes swapdata without reading from mainnet , that is locally


[03/07/2024 14:55] kalinbas
its because you need to set POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH as described in readme


[03/07/2024 14:56] kalinbas
locally you need to create all uniswap contracts including universalrouter to test this, or you can mock the needed contracts


[03/07/2024 14:58] web3tycoon
ok where do i get the POOL_INIT_CODE_HASH


[03/07/2024 15:01] web3tycoon
ok i see


[03/07/2024 15:55] santiellena
it's on the readme


[03/07/2024 15:55] santiellena

[03/08/2024 09:45] web3tycoon
@kalinbas just for clarification 
in Ivault.sol while deacreasing liquidity we remvoe the positions liquidity plus fees and 
when we call collect we dont remove the position but collect the fees accrued >


[03/08/2024 09:48] kalinbas
for decreasing liquidity it depends what is set in the params. the liquidity parameters says how much to remove from liquidity.. feeAmount0 / feeAmount1 how much from fees


[03/08/2024 09:49] kalinbas
And the sum of these two amounts is "collected" automatically from the NonfungiblePositionManager (if thats what you are asking)

if you set liquidity to 0 and feeAmount0 / feeAmount1 to max value - all fees are collected only


[03/08/2024 10:05] web3tycoon
@kalinbas okay just for clarification what is returned in automator.sol ` _decreaseFullLiquidityAndCollect` for feeAmount its all the fees


[03/08/2024 10:05] web3tycoon
or?


[03/08/2024 10:07] kalinbas
it is all the amounts defined from liquidity parameter + what you specified in feeAmount0 / feeAmount1


[03/08/2024 10:07] kalinbas
so if there is liquidity > 0 and feeAmount0 = 0 / feeAmount1 = 0, only the amounts from the liquidity are returned


[03/08/2024 10:08] kalinbas
better check the code of the _decreaseFullLiquidityAndCollect() function its easier to understand than my text 🙂

Hi @kalinbas any particular reason or benefit in Q32 & Q96 based precision calculations over the regular 10**x.


[03/08/2024 12:08] santiellena
Hi! I'm having a hard time understanding the difference between `balance`, `available`, and `reserves` values which are calculated on `V3Vault::_getAvailableBalance`. Do you know any resource where I can read or understand the concepts and why they are calculated that way? Thanks in advance ❤️


[03/08/2024 12:10] kalinbas
balance is just the contracts balance of the asset, available is the part of the balance which is not part of the reserves, and reserves it the amount that must be kept in the contract

@kalinbas Hi! How are you expecting to set `globalDebtLimit` and `globalLendLimit`? Are they going to be same amount?  Or `globalLendLimit` could be bigger, for example.


[03/08/2024 21:42] jecikzerrikan
I think the point is to charge more the borrowers than you give to lenders to make some profit


[03/08/2024 21:48] santiellena
Sure, but those variables have nothing to do with profit. They are just limits that the owner sets. `totalSupply()` cannot be bigger than `globalLendLimit` and `debtSharesTotal` cannot be bigger than `_convertToShares(globalDebtLimit, newDebtExchangeRateX96, Math.Rounding.Down)`. I think that those vars are for managing risk in the protocol.


[03/08/2024 21:52] jecikzerrikan
you're right, I didn't read correctly your question. I thought you were refering to the rates. sorry!

[03/11/2024 01:22] kennedybailey
Are operators trusted in this protocol?


[03/11/2024 07:12] kalinbas
They are partially trusted (and run by Revert) because they can decide how the offchain calculated swaps are calculated. But the protocol protects the positions by letting owners define max slippage/price impact.


[03/11/2024 07:14] kalinbas
Also there is an TWAP oracle used to protect from sandwich attacks trying to game the slippage protection.

Could smone help me to understand it. How exacty the tokenId could be changed in the meantinme(during the transform function), if in the blockchain all tx are executed in order.
```
// may have changed in the meantime
        tokenId = transformedTokenId;
```


[03/11/2024 10:20] kalinbas
hm there is a callback before this line.. the line (bool success,) = transformer.call(data);


[03/11/2024 10:21] kalinbas
calls the transformer contract which may send a new token to the vault in the meantime


[03/11/2024 10:21] kalinbas
which would call onERC721Received


[03/11/2024 10:21] kalinbas
and this function can update the transformedTokenId

@kalinbas  are this two equal `oldDebtExchangeRateX96, oldLendExchangeRateX96`


[03/13/2024 07:50] alix40
Nope, there is a reserve factor used in between, so in most cases debtexchangerate should be bigger ( borrow interest rate is bigger than the supply interest rate some of the difference get set as reserves for the protocol that they can withdraw)


[03/13/2024 08:00] kennedybailey
What is the meaning of this protocol's name-"revert-lend"?


[03/13/2024 08:43] jecikzerrikan
yeah, but actually the difference between the debtExchangeRate and lendExchangeRate doesn't matter, what matters is that the debtExchangeRate is accruing faster than the lendExchangeRate.


[03/13/2024 08:54] guy_in0xnito
I have two questions
1. How does the protocol transform (not the types of transform) the position is this the reason flashloan is used ?
2. How does automator come into the context?
@kalinbas  pinning this up


[03/13/2024 09:25] vikqaz
How can `debtExchangeRate` accrue faster than `lendExchangeRate`?


[03/13/2024 09:26] vikqaz
thanks 🙌🏻


[03/13/2024 09:29] jecikzerrikan
have a look at the InterestRateModel.getRatesPerSecond() it calculates both per second values for debt and exchange rate (they are called there differently - borrowRate (for debt) and supplyRate (for lend), supplyRate is de facto borrowRate multiplied by the utilisationRate, which is always below 1. So it is always smaller than borrowRate

[03/14/2024 10:46] kalinbas
1. transform means when a position is in vault, it may be changed, temporarely ignoring collateralization requirements and only at the end of tx it is checked (similar to a flash loan)


[03/14/2024 10:48] kalinbas
2. Automators are contracts which have the permission to Automate certain actions for approved positions. This works with standalone positions but also with positions in vault (and thats where transform method comes into play)


[03/14/2024 15:53] jecikzerrikan
Hi @kalinbas, the referenceToken and chainLinkReferenceTokens, are they supposed to be different from the asset token?


[03/14/2024 15:55] kalinbas
They are independent.


[03/14/2024 15:55] kalinbas
chainLinkReferenceTokens is the other token in chainlink feed (usually USD or ETH)


[03/14/2024 15:55] kalinbas
referenceToken is the other token in TWAP pairs usually WETH or USDC


[03/14/2024 15:55] kalinbas
asset probably will be USDC or DAI


[03/14/2024 16:00] jecikzerrikan
I see, so if the Asset of the Vault is, let's say USDC, the Oracle's reference token is WETH, and the collateral we need the price of is LINK, then Chainlink will calculate the price as: (USDC/WETH) / (LINK/WETH). Is this correct?

[04/04/2024 20:56] thank_you_
I discovered an invalid bug that is currently considered valid by the judges. What recourse do I have right now?

UPDATE: posted comment in issue in hopes that judges will be able to respond. Apologizes if I missed the comment window.

[04/08/2024 13:56] olanre_waju
As you a can see, its been only 3weeks since the completion of this contest.

Judge and lookout have been really fast to have completed judging the contest in such a short period. Normally, it takes an average of 4weeks, so we are not in delay yet, we should exercise patience 😉 

It's done already,  you'll be served soon🤣🤣🤣
